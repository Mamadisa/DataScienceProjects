# Data Science and Portfolio Analysis Projects
This repository is a collection of some of the models I have been working on to showcase my coding skills.

#Project 1:
A simple model that fetches financial data using the yfinance API to collect historical data from Yahoo Finance for analysis and enables users to analyze historical stock data efficiently and visualize market trends using different charts. 
The model processes the data and provides the user with three visualization options:
Candlestick Chart: 
Visualizes the open, close, high, and low prices of the stock over time and incorporates time series analysis by plotting key indicators such as Relative Strength Index which measures the momentum of price changes.
Bar Chart: 
Visualizes the trading volumes for the selected period.
Line Chart:
Visualizes the movement of the closing price over time.
