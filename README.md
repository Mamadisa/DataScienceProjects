# Data Science and Portfolio Analysis Projects
This repository is a collection of some of the models I have been working on to showcase my coding skills.

#Project 1:
A simple Model that fetches financial data using yfinance API to collect Historical data from Yahoo Finance for analysis. At its simplest the model collects data and gives user the option to either visualise the data using 3 options- candlesticks(for open, close, high and low prices) barchart(for trading volumes) and linechart(for movement of the closing price)
